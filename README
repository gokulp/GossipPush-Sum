Distributed Operating Systems (Fall 2015)
Project 2 - Gossip Simulator

Group Members – Gokul Palwe (0119-6899) and Sahil Pratap(9998-4988)

The Gossip and Push-Sum algorithms have been implemented for line, full, 3D and imperfect 3D 
In Gossip Algorithm, each actor keeps track of how many times it has heard the rumor. An actor 
terminates when it has received the rumor 10 times. In case of Push-Sum Algorithm, if an actor’s ratio 
s/w did not change more than 10^10 in 3 consecutive rounds the actor terminates. When an actor 
terminates, all its neighbors remove the actor from their neighbor list and continue with the remaining 
Largest Network we were able to propagate through using Gossip Algorithm
Topology Largest Number of Nodes 
Line     1000 
Full     1000 
3D       1000 
Imp 3D   1000

HOW TO RUN?
======================================================================================================

GossipSimulator contains files from IntelliJ Idea 13. 
Project can be run in sbt directly or import project as SBT project in eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

To run inside sbt command line use

run <NUM_NODES> <topology> <algorithm>

	NUM_NODES: Integer values indicating number of nodes in the topology. For 3D and imp3D number of
	           nodes will be rounded up to nearest perfect cube.

	topology:  topology takes 4 values(case sensative).
			1. line
			2. full
			3. 3D
			4. imp3D

	algorithm: Algorithm takes 2 unique values.
			1. gossip
			2. push-sum
